## Task 6: Console Registration Program

### Solution 1: Console Application

- The username must consist only of Latin alphabet characters.
- The password must consist of numbers and symbols.
- If either validation fails, the program will notify the user and request new inputs.

### Solution 2: AvaloniaUI Solution
